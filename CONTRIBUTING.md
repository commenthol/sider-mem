# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to the project!

We would love for you to contribute to our project with

- Feature requests

For Pull Requests please make sure that all tests and the linter passes  
Use:

New features or bug fixes require one or more test-cases to get accepted. 
We use [mocha](https://mochajs.org/#getting-started) together with the 
node [assert](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/assert.html) library.
